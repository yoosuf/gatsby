The best deployment can cause problems down the road if someone didn’t build it to be reusable and adaptable. But a great front-end developer brings designs to the fullness of their intention and sets up a webpage to be flexible and successful years into the future.</p>\n    <Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
